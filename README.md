RubiksPocketSolver
==================

Solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube with BFS

Please note that cube initial state should be an orientation
in which DBL is solved.

The rest of the cubies are numbered as follows:


ULB->0,URB->1,URF->2,UFL->3
DRB->4,DRF->5,DFL->6

Solver is only R,U,F  optimal. Also, no GUI yet. TODO
